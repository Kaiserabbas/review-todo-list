# To-Do List Project

  <h2><b>To-Do List Project</b></h2>
The To-Do List Application is a simple web-based task management tool that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. This application is designed to help individuals organize their tasks and keep track of their daily activities.
This is a simple web application that allows you to manage your to-do list. You can add, edit, and remove tasks as needed. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

The To-Do List Application comes with the following features:

Task Creation: Users can easily create new tasks by providing a task name, description, and due date. Each task is then added to the list of pending tasks.

Task View: Users can view their list of pending tasks, sorted by due date or priority, to have a clear overview of their pending tasks.

Task Editing: Users can modify task details, such as the name, description, due date, or priority level. This allows users to keep their tasks up-to-date as their requirements change.

Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as complete once they finish them. Completed tasks are moved to a separate list, providing a sense of accomplishment.

Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks they no longer need or want to track. This helps keep the task list relevant and clutter-free.

Task Search: The application allows users to search for specific tasks based on keywords or due dates. This feature is handy when dealing with a large number of tasks.
